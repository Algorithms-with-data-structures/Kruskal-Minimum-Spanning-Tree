# Kruskal's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

This repository contains an implementation of Kruskal's algorithm in C++ to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph. The program provides functionalities for loading a graph from a file, generating a random graph, and finding the MST using Kruskal's algorithm.

## üìö **Theory: What is Kruskal's Algorithm?**
Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the MST of a connected, weighted graph. The MST is a subgraph that:
- Includes all vertices of the original graph.
- Has the minimum possible total edge weight.
- Does not form cycles.

### **Steps of Kruskal's Algorithm:**
1. **Sort:** Sort all edges in ascending order of their weights.
2. **Pick Edges:** Add edges one by one to the MST, ensuring that no cycles are formed.
3. **Stop:** Continue until the MST includes all vertices (with exactly \(n-1\) edges, where \(n\) is the number of vertices).

The algorithm is efficient for sparse graphs and widely used in network optimization problems like designing computer, road, or electrical networks.

## üñ•Ô∏è **Program Features**

### **1. Load Graph from File**
The program reads a graph from a file named `graph.txt`.
- The file should have the following format:
  ```
  <number_of_vertices>
  <number_of_edges>
  <from_node> <to_node> <cost>
  <from_node> <to_node> <cost>
  ...
  ```
  Example:
  ```
  8
  13
  1 2 1
  2 3 2
  4 6 2
  ...
  ```

### **2. Generate Random Graph**
Generate a random graph with a user-specified number of vertices. The graph is undirected and has randomly assigned edge weights.

### **3. Run Kruskal's Algorithm**
Find the MST of the graph using Kruskal's algorithm. The program ensures that the graph is connected before proceeding.

### **4. Display Results**
View the edges included in the MST along with their weights.
